# ferry-data-visualization

## About this project
We created this project during the 'Dataweek' in the Information Design theme semester. We had about two to three days to create this project, we were kind of in a hurry, but still manager to create something great! I (Victor Boucher) did all the code, Sam Lansdaal and Gosro Poorheydar did all the designing, storytelling, UX/UI and animations.

For the data we went to the ferries at the Central Station in Amsterdam, we stayed there for about two hours counting everybody that was coming off the ferry. We were couting everybody that was wearing a facemask or not, we also wrote down what type of passenger they were (pedestrian, cyclist or moped driver). We noticed that a lot of people take of their mask before leaving the ferry, but the moment you leave the ferry, you are the closest to other people.   

Most of the illustrations are made in Illustrator, then exported as SVG, and then implemented/animated in the code. All the interaction is ofcourse done with code. The whole project is built in ReactJS.
